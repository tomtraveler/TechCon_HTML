All rights reserved.</p> </footer> I've structured the About page into three main sections: History, Mission, and Past Speakers. Each section is contained within an <article> tag and includes relevant content, images, and icons. The navigation menu is consistent with the homepage, and the footer is identical to ensure consistency across all pages. Note that you'll need to create the necessary images (history-image1.jpg, history-image2.jpg, mission-icon.png, speaker1.jpg, speaker2.jpg) and add them to the same directory as the HTML file.</article>
